# We will create these secrets (if necessary) _even if_ we aren't
# currently using CeleryExecutor or CeleryKubernetesExecutor. As we are
# relying on the "pre-install" hack to prevent changing randomly generated passwords,
# updating the executor later doesn't give us the opportunity to deploy them
# when we need them. We will always deploy them defensively to make the executor
# update path actually work.

NOTES:
Thank you for installing Apache Airflow 2.1.4!

Your release is named airflow.
You can now access your dashboard(s) by executing the following command(s) and visiting the corresponding port at localhost in your browser:

Airflow Webserver:     kubectl port-forward svc/airflow-webserver 8080:8080 --namespace default
Default Webserver (Airflow UI) Login credentials:
    username: admin
    password: admin
Default Postgres connection credentials:
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
    port: 5432

You can get Fernet Key value by running the following:

    echo Fernet Key: $(kubectl get secret --namespace default airflow-fernet-key -o jsonpath="{.data.fernet-key}" | base64 --decode)

WARNING:
    Kubernetes workers task logs may not persist unless you configure log persistence or remote logging!
    Logging options can be found at: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/manage-logs.html
    (This warning can be ignored if logging is configured with environment variables or secrets backend)

###########################################################
#  WARNING: You should set a static webserver secret key  #
###########################################################

You are using a dynamically generated webserver secret key, which can lead to
unnecessary restarts of your Airflow components.

Information on how to set a static webserver secret key can be found here:
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/production-guide.html#webserver-secret-key
